    gcloud topic configurations - supplementary help for named configurations

[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    gcloud properties can be stored in [1mnamed configurations[m, which are
    collections of key-value pairs that influence the behavior of gcloud.

    Named configurations are intended to be an advanced feature, and you can
    probably ignore them entirely if you only work with one project.

    Properties that are commonly stored in configurations include default
    Google Compute Engine zone, verbosity level, project ID, and active user or
    service account. Configurations allow you to define and enable these and
    other settings together as a group.

    Configurations are especially useful if you:
      â–ª Work with multiple projects. You can create a separate configuration
        for each project.
      â–ª Use multiple accounts, for example, a user account and a service
        account, etc.
      â–ª Perform generally orthogonal tasks (work on an appengine app in
        project foo, administer a Google Compute Engine cluster in zone
        user-central-1a, manage the network configurations for region
        asia-east-1, etc.)

    Property information stored in named configurations are readable by all
    gcloud commands and may be modified by [1mgcloud config set[m and [1mgcloud config
    unset[m.

[m[1mCreating configurations[m

    Named configurations may be defined by users or built into gcloud.

    User defined configurations have lowercase names, such as 'johndoe',
    'default', 'jeff-staging', or 'foo2'. These are defined by the following
    regular expression: [1m^[a-z][-a-z0-9]*$[m

    Additionally there is a builtin configuration named NONE that has no
    properties set.

    The easiest way to create a brand new configuration is by running

        $ gcloud init

    This will guide you through setting up your first named configuration,
    creating a new named configuration, or reinitializing an existing named
    configuration. (Note: reinitializing an existing configuration will remove
    all its existing properties!)

    You can create a new empty configuration with

        $ gcloud config configurations create my-config

[m[1mUsing configurations[m

    gcloud may have at most one [1mactive[m configuration which provides property
    values. Inactive configurations have no effect on gcloud executions.

    You can activate a configuration with

        $ gcloud config configurations activate my-config

    To display the path of the active configuration, run:

        $ gcloud info --format="get(config.paths.active_config_path)"

    Note that changes to your OS login, Google Cloud Platform account or
    project could change the path.

    You can view and change the properties of your active configuration using
    the following commands:

        $ gcloud config list
        $ gcloud config set

    Additionally, commands under [1mgcloud config configurations[m allow you to to
    list, activate, describe, and delete configurations that may or may not be
    active.

    You can activate a configuration for a single gcloud invocation using flag,
    [1m--configuration my-config[m, or environment variable
    [1mCLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME=my-config[m.

[m[1mAVAILABLE PROPERTIES[m
     [4mcore[m
         [1maccount[m
            Account [1mgcloud[m should use for authentication. Run [1mgcloud auth list[m
            to see your currently available accounts.

         [1mcustom_ca_certs_file[m
            Absolute path to a custom CA cert file.

         [1mdefault_regional_backend_service[m
            If True, backend services in [1mgcloud compute backend-services[m will
            be regional by default. Setting the [1m--global[m flag is required for
            global backend services.

         [1mdisable_color[m
            If True, color will not be used when printing messages in the
            terminal.

         [1mdisable_file_logging[m
            If True, [1mgcloud[m will not store logs to a file. This may be useful
            if disk space is limited.

         [1mdisable_prompts[m
            If True, the default answer will be assumed for all user prompts.
            However, for any prompts that require user input, an error will be
            raised. This is equivalent to either using the global [1m--quiet[m flag
            or setting the environment variable [1mCLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS[m
            to 1. Setting this property is useful when scripting with [1mgcloud[m.

         [1mdisable_usage_reporting[m
            If True, anonymous statistics on SDK usage will not be collected.
            This value is set by default based on your choices during
            installation, but can be changed at any time. For more information,
            see: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/usage-statistics

         [1mlog_http[m
            If True, log HTTP requests and responses to the logs. To see logs
            in the terminal, adjust [1mverbosity[m settings. Otherwise, logs are
            available in their respective log files.

         [1mmax_log_days[m
            Maximum number of days to retain log files before deleting. If set
            to 0, turns off log garbage collection and does not delete log
            files. If unset, the default is 30 days.

         [1mpass_credentials_to_gsutil[m
            If True, pass the configured Cloud SDK authentication to gsutil.

         [1mproject[m
            Project ID of the Cloud Platform project to operate on by default.
            This can be overridden by using the global [1m--project[m flag.

         [1mshow_structured_logs[m
            Control when JSON-structured log messages for the current verbosity
            level (and above) will be written to standard error. If this
            property is disabled, logs are formatted as [1mtext[m by default.

            Valid values are:
            â–¸ [1mnever[m - Log messages as text
            â–¸ [1malways[m - Always log messages as JSON
            â–¸ [1mlog[m - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a file
            â–¸ [1mterminal[m - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a terminal

    If unset, default is [1mnever[m.

         [1mtrace_token[m
            Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
            issues. This token will be provided by Google support.

         [1muser_output_enabled[m
            True, by default. If False, messages to the user and command output
            on both standard output and standard error will be suppressed.

         [1mverbosity[m
            Default logging verbosity for [1mgcloud[m commands. This is the
            equivalent of using the global [1m--verbosity[m flag. Supported
            verbosity levels: [1mdebug[m, [1minfo[m, [1mwarning[m, [1merror[m, [1mcritical[m, and [1mnone[m.

     [4maccessibility[m
         [1mscreen_reader[m
            Make gcloud more screen reader friendly.

     [4mai[m
         [1mregion[m
            Default region to use when working withAI Platform resources. When
            a [1m--region[m flag is required but not provided, the command will fall
            back to this value, if set.

     [4mai_platform[m
         [1mregion[m
            Default region to use when working with AI Platform Training and
            Prediction resources (currently for Prediction only). It is ignored
            for training resources for now. The value should be either [1mglobal[m
            or one of the supported regions. When a [1m--region[m flag is required
            but not provided, the command will fall back to this value, if set.

     [4mapp[m
         [1mcloud_build_timeout[m
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for Docker builds to complete during
            deployments. All Docker builds now use the Cloud Build API.

         [1mpromote_by_default[m
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, that version
            will be promoted to receive all traffic for the service. This
            property can be overridden via the [1m--promote-by-default[m or
            [1m--no-promote-by-default[m flags.

         [1mstop_previous_version[m
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, the previously
            deployed version is stopped. If False, older versions must be
            stopped manually.

         [1muse_runtime_builders[m
            If set, opt in/out to a new code path for building applications
            using pre-fabricated runtimes that can be updated independently of
            client tooling. If not set, the default path for each runtime is
            used.

     [4martifacts[m
         [1mlocation[m
            Default location to use when working with Artifact Registry
            resources. When a [1mlocation[m value is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. If this value is
            unset, the default location is [1mglobal[m when [1mlocation[m value is
            optional.

         [1mrepository[m
            Default repository to use when working with Artifact Registry
            resources. When a [1mrepository[m value is required but not provided,
            the command will fall back to this value, if set.

     [4mauth[m
         [1mdisable_credentials[m
            If True, [1mgcloud[m will not attempt to load any credentials or
            authenticate any requests. This is useful when behind a proxy that
            adds authentication to requests.

         [1mimpersonate_service_account[m
            After setting this property, all API requests will be made as the
            given service account instead of the currently selected account.
            This is done without needing to create, download, and activate a
            key for the account. In order to perform operations as the service
            account, your currently selected account must have an IAM role that
            includes the iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission for the
            service account. The roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role has
            this permission or you may create a custom role.

     [4mbilling[m
         [1mquota_project[m
            Project that will be charged quota for the operations performed in
            [1mgcloud[m. When unset, the default is [CURRENT_PROJECT]; this will
            charge quota against the currently set project for operations
            performed on it. Additionally, some existing APIs will continue to
            use a shared project for quota by default, when this property is
            unset.

            If you need to operate on one project, but need quota against a
            different project, you can use this property to specify the
            alternate project.

     [4mbuilds[m
         [1mkaniko_cache_ttl[m
            TTL, in hours, of cached layers when using Kaniko. If zero, layer
            caching is disabled.

         [1mtimeout[m
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for builds to complete. If unset,
            defaults to 10 minutes.

         [1muse_kaniko[m
            If True, kaniko will be used to build images described by a
            Dockerfile, instead of [1mdocker build[m.

     [4mcomponent_manager[m
         [1madditional_repositories[m
            Comma separated list of additional repositories to check for

            components repositories[m commands.

         [1mdisable_update_check[m
            If True, Cloud SDK will not automatically check for updates.

     [4mcomposer[m
         [1mlocation[m
            Composer location to use. Each Composer location constitutes an
            independent resource namespace constrained to deploying
            environments into Compute Engine regions inside this location. This
            parameter corresponds to the /locations/<location> segment of the
            Composer resource URIs being referenced.

     [4mcompute[m
         [1mregion[m
            Default region to use when working with regional Compute Engine
            resources. When a [1m--region[m flag is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. To see valid choices,
            run [1mgcloud compute regions list[m.

         [1muse_new_list_usable_subnets_api[m

            Engine.

         [1muse_application_default_credentials[m
            If True, use application default credentials to authenticate to the
            cluster API server.

         [1muse_client_certificate[m
            If True, use the cluster's client certificate to authenticate to
            the cluster API server.

     [4mcontext_aware[m
         [1muse_client_certificate[m
            If True, use client certificate to authorize user device using
            Context-aware access. Some services may not support client
            certificate authorization. If a command sends requests to such
            services, the client certificate will not be validated. Run [1mgcloud
            topic client-certificate[m for list of services supporting this
            feature.

     [4mdataflow[m
         [1mdisable_public_ips[m
