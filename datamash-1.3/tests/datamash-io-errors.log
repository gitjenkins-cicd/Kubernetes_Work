datamash-io-errors.sh: skipped test: expensive: disabled by default
This test is relatively expensive, so it is disabled by default.
To run it anyway, rerun make check with the RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS
environment variable set to yes.  E.g.,

  env RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes make check

or use the shortcut target of the toplevel Makefile,

  make check-expensive

SKIP tests/datamash-io-errors.sh (exit status: 77)
